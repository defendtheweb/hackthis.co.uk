    <h2>1. General Information Regarding These Master Terms of Use (“Master Terms”).</h2>
    Please read these terms carefully because they apply to your use of all of the websites that HackThis!! (collectively, the websites to which these terms apply, the “Websites”), including the products and services provided through the Websites (collectively, the “Services”). Websites include, but are not limited to, the websites operated at http://hackthis.co.uk. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with HackThis!!, your use of any Website or Service will always be subject to, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to as the “Master Terms.”
    <br/><br/>
    In addition, your use of any Website or Service may also be subject to the terms of any legal notice applicable to the Website or Service, in addition to the Master Terms. All such terms supplementing these Master Terms are referred to below as the “Additional Terms.” Where Additional Terms apply to a Website or Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Website or Service.
    <br/><br/>
    The Master Terms, together with any Additional Terms, form a binding legal agreement between you and HackThis!! in relation to your use of the Websites and the Services. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms.” If there is any contradiction between the Additional Terms and the Master Terms, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to the Website or Service to which the Additional Terms apply.
